app folder:

streamlit_app.py: This is the main Streamlit application file. You'll define your Streamlit app and its structure here.

pages directory: Each page of your multi-page Streamlit app has its own Python file. These files contain the Streamlit code specific to each page. Here's what these pages might contain:

home.py: Streamlit code for the home page, which displays available conference rooms and serves as the main entry point.
booking.py: Streamlit code for the booking page where users can submit booking requests.
admin.py: Streamlit code for the admin dashboard, allowing administrators to manage rooms and permissions.
user_profile.py: Streamlit code for the user profile page, where registered users can view and update their profiles.
init.py: Initialize your Flask app and other necessary configurations.

routes.py: Define routes for your Flask app, which can handle data processing, database interactions, and more. Streamlit pages will interact with these routes for data retrieval and updates.

database folder:

database.db: The SQLite database file (or another database of your choice) to store information about conference rooms, user data, bookings, and permissions.
venv (virtual environment - optional): Create a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. You can use venv or virtualenv.

config.py: Configuration settings for your Flask application, including database configurations and other app-specific settings.

run.py: The main entry point for running your Flask application, which can handle any API-related routes and interactions.
